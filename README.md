# wif-elf
A little helper that keeps track of your position in a weaving draft. (Not quite a dobby!)

# How do I use it?
First, have a direct tie-up on your loom. Next, pick out a draft you want to weave and get it in WIF format.

Save the WIF file to your phone or tablet. (I emailed it to myself.) Open http://diversiforge.github.io/wif-elf/www/index.html in your device's browser. Scroll down and open the WIF file. Scroll back up and behold your shed sequence!

# What if I need to restart, or use my phone for something else?
Reopen the site and it will pick up where you left off. The elf can only remember one WIF at a time, though, so if you open another one it will forget all about the last one.

# Why?
I didn't want to keep a complicated overshot pattern in my head, so I decided to tape my phone to my loom and make it do all the work instead.

# I don't want to give you my WIF!
You're not. All of the processing happens on your device and I see none of it. In fact, you could save the whole page to your computer and open it offline, and it would still work. (Well, as long as you saved the complete page. Your browser probably has an option to do this.

# It's not working on my computer/phone/tablet.
I tried to make it as simple and backwards-compatible as possible, but the best I can do is IE 10/Firefox 33/some recent version of Chrome. Chrome 39 works on my phone, but I can't speak for Apple devices.

# The interface/code is ugly.
Making it pretty is time I could be spending weaving. If you want it to be pretty, submit a pull request. :)
